# A Recipes Application

The purpose of this project is to progressively build a non-trivial AngularJS application. The application is a web application which hosts recipes. As we grow the application, we'll post milestones below.

##The Backstory
CoolSquared is an "internet" company which makes money off of advertising revenue. Their business model involves hosting curated 
content on the interwebs which draws visitors because of its richness and professional presentation. In the following scenario CoolSquared 
wants to create an application for hosting recipes. The application will start as a read-only website containing a small set of recipes, will integrate with 3rd party identity providers, and will eventually allow the public at large to add content.
